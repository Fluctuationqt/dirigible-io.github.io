SQL View
===

The **SQL** view is one of the most powerful tools for database management.
In the SQL console you can enter and execute SQL scripts, compliant to the underlying database system.

!!! note

    Scripts are executed by pressing:

    - Windows : ++ctrl+x++
    - Mac: ++command+x++

In [Database View](https://www.dirigible.io/help/development/ide/views/database/) you can press the refresh button, and preview the data by selecting **Show Content**. You get the result of the execution in the **Results** view below.
