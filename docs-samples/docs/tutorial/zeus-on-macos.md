Zeus on Kubernetes with MacOS
===

### Prerequisites

* Have a Homebrew installed - [https://docs.brew.sh/Installation](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation)


### Install Kubernetes command-line tool

* Run the following command:

> brew install kubectl

* To verify that the version youâ€™ve installed is up-to-date, run:

> kubectl version

### Install Minikube

  Install **Minikube v0.27.0**

> curl -Lo minikube https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/v0.27.0/minikube-darwin-amd64 && chmod +x minikube && sudo mv minikube /usr/local/bin/



### Additional Steps with Docker

#### Install Docker 

* Install it using Hombrew:

> brew cask install docker

* Open Docker.app and continue the installation of the network (Ctrl+Space)

#### Build the image

Build an image without uploading it:

* Set the environment variables with 

> eval $(minikube docker-env)

* Clone the Zeus packaging project:

> git clone https://github.com/dirigiblelabs/zeus-v3-package.git

* Build the image with the Docker daemon of Minikube:

> cd zeus-v3-package/zeus 

> mvn clean install

> docker build -t zeus .

* Set the image in the pod spec like the build tag: **zeus**

* Set the **imagePullPolicy** to **Never**, otherwise Kubernetes will try to download the image

> Important note: You have to run eval ** $(minikube docker-env)** on each terminal you want to use, since it only sets the environment variables for the current shell session.
